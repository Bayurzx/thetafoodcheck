# FoodCheck AI

FoodCheck AI is an innovative web application designed to help users make healthier and more informed food choices. By leveraging AI and blockchain technologies, FoodCheck AI analyzes food ingredients and provides personalized health insights based on the user's unique health profile.

## Inspiration

Have you ever found yourself staring at a food label, unsure if it's good for you? We created FoodCheck AI to simplify this process. Inspired by the everyday struggle of making informed food choices, our app provides personalized advice, warnings, and recommendations to help users make the best decisions for their health.

## What It Does

FoodCheck AI allows users to take a picture of food product ingredients and receive immediate feedback on whether the content is suitable for them based on their health data. The app provides personalized warnings, advice, recommendations, and interesting food facts to guide users in their food choices.

## How We Built It

We built FoodCheck AI using a combination of powerful technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, React Toastify
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Google Cloud Vision AI, OpenAI API, NextAuth.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Blockchain**: Ethers.js, wagmi, RainbowKit
- **Cloud Services**: ThetaEdgeCloud (Jupyter Notebooks)
- **Hosting**: (e.g., Vercel, AWS)

## Main Features

- **Personalized Insights**: Get tailored advice based on your unique health profile.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Snap a picture and get instant feedback on food products.
- **Health Warnings**: Receive alerts for ingredients that may be harmful to you.
- **Educational Content**: Learn about the ingredients in your food and their impact on your health.
